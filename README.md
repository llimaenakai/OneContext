2. Share Agent Context so Anyone can Talk to it on Slack.
3. Load the Context to Agents, so Anyone can Continue from the Same Point.
  
## Quick Install
 Install: 
 ```
 npm i -g onecontext-ai
 ```

 This will automatically install the latest ```onecontext-ai``` Python package using the best available Python package manager (```uv``` > ```pipx``` > ```pip3``` > ```pip```).
 
 **Prerequisites**
 * Node.js >= 16
 * Python 3.11+ with one of: ```uv```, ```pipx```, ```pip3```, or ```pip```

## Quick Start
Run: 
```
onecontext
```

## Usage
After installation, the following commands are available:
```
onecontext-ai <command> [args...]
onecontext <command> [args...]
oc <command> [args...]
```
All three commands are equivalent and proxy to the underlying Python CLI.

**Examples**
```
# Check version
onecontext version

# Show help
onecontext --help

# Short alias
oc version
```

## Updating the Python Package
The npm wrapper installs the latest ```onecontext``` on ```npm``` install.
For normal users, use the unified upgrade command:
```
# Recommended
onecontext update
```

If upgrade routing is broken, repair once and retry:
```
onecontext doctor --fix-upgrade
onecontext update
```
Use ```npm rebuild onecontext-ai``` only when the npm wrapper links/cached paths are stale.

## Troubleshooting
If the commands aren't found after installation:
1. Repair and update: ```onecontext doctor --fix-upgrade && onecontext update```
2. Rebuild wrapper links if needed: ```npm rebuild onecontext-ai```
3. Check that ```onecontext``` is on your PATH: ```which onecontext```
